IST261_Semester_Project is a studio class assignment showcasing my skills with the MVC structure, as well as API calls and basic UI design. This project also represents my skills with data persistance. I utilized the Agile development process to create smaller working deliverables throughout the semester, which streamlined the process of creating a large project, as well as reduced errors.
